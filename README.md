## 📖 About the Project

Finding relevant research papers through traditional keyword search can be challenging because different papers often describe the same concept using different terminology.

This project solves that problem by implementing a **Semantic Research Paper Search Engine** powered by **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Transformer-based sentence embeddings**.

Instead of matching exact words, the system understands the **context and semantic meaning** of a user's query, allowing it to retrieve the most relevant research papers—even when the query and the paper use different vocabulary.

The project was developed as part of the **CBSOT Summer Internship 2026** to explore modern Information Retrieval techniques using state-of-the-art NLP models.

# ▶️ Running the Project

### Step 1 — Generate Embeddings

Run

```text
EDA.ipynb
```

This notebook:

* Loads the dataset
* Cleans the data
* Performs Exploratory Data Analysis
* Generates semantic embeddings

---

### Step 2 — Search Papers

Run

```text
Search_Engine.ipynb
```

This notebook:

* Loads saved embeddings
* Creates (or loads) the FAISS index
* Accepts a natural language query
* Returns the most semantically similar research papers

---

# 💡 Example

### User Query

```text
Deep learning techniques for image classification
```

### Output

✔ Most Relevant Research Papers

✔ Similarity Scores

✔ Paper Titles

✔ Research Abstracts

# 🧠 How Semantic Search Works

Unlike traditional keyword search:

❌ Keyword Search

* Matches exact words
* Misses related concepts
* Sensitive to wording

✅ Semantic Search

* Understands context
* Finds conceptually similar papers
* Uses dense vector embeddings
* Produces more meaningful search results
